                At the Florida Institute of Technology, one of Florida’s premier
                STEM universities, I embarked on a new chapter both academically
                and personally. Transferring schools meant leaving behind my
                friends and family to pursue my Computer Science degree, and
                while the adjustment was challenging, it has been one of the
                most rewarding experiences of my life. I am currently a
                sophomore, making the most of every opportunity to grow. <br />
                <br />
                In Spring 2025, I rushed and was initiated into Chi Phi
                Fraternity, the nation’s oldest social fraternity. This
                brotherhood has given me the chance to form meaningful
                friendships with peers from across the country, while also
                engaging in service projects that reminded me education is not
                only about ambition, but also about purpose. I’ve had the
                privilege of supporting causes such as a local orphanage, Gift
                of Life, and Wounded Warriors—experiences that have instilled in
                me a deeper commitment to service and community. <br />
                <br />
                In August 2025, I was inducted into Upsilon Pi Epsilon (UPE),
                the international honor society for computing sciences. Joining
                this prestigious organization has allowed me to connect with the
                top students in my field and give back through tutoring at the
                Computer Science help desk. Looking ahead, I am excited to
                represent Florida Tech with the Competitive Programming Team,
                including the upcoming International Collegiate Programming
                Contest (ICPC).
                <br />
                <br />
                Academically, I have remained dedicated to excellence, earning
                Dean’s List honors in both semesters so far. This distinction
                also led to my induction into Phi Eta Sigma, a national honor
                society that recognizes first-year academic achievement. Beyond
                academics, I spent a year with the Florida Tech Club Soccer
                Team, where I trained and competed with peers across the
                division, reinforcing lessons of discipline and teamwork. My
                time at Florida Tech has been one of transformation—balancing
                scholarship, service, leadership, and personal growth.

              <p className="timeline-abt">
                After graduating secondary school in May 2023, I began my
                tertiary journey at the University of the West Indies (UWI), the
                Caribbean’s largest and most prestigious university. Although my
                time there was brief—thanks to the tremendous fortune of winning
                an Open Scholarship that allowed me to continue my undergraduate
                studies abroad at Florida Tech—my UWI experience was both
                meaningful and memorable. <br />
                <br />
                One of the greatest honors of my life was being named the Top
                Matriculant 2023/24, an award presented to just one student out
                of hundreds in the incoming class. More than recognizing
                academic achievement, it highlighted qualities of leadership and
                well-roundedness. At the matriculation ceremony in September
                2023, I had the privilege of signing the symbolic Matriculation
                Register on behalf of my cohort—a moment that filled me with
                immense pride and gratitude. This recognition opened doors to
                further opportunities, including being interviewed and featured
                on the front cover of UWI Today, the university’s official
                publication.
                <br />
                <br /> Even within that short period, I remained committed to
                academic excellence, earning a 4.12 GPA with Dean’s List honors.
                My time at UWI reinforced my confidence in what I could achieve
                and laid the foundation for the next chapter of my education.

              In 2023, the Ministry of Education TT awarded 45 open scholarships
              to the top-performing students nationally in the CAPE 2022/23

              prestigious honor that recognizes outstanding academic achievement
              in my field. I was privileged to be one of these few recipients,
              earning a full-ride scholarship that covers my tuition at any
              accredited university worldwide. This enabled me to pursue my
              undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Florida Institute of
              Technology.

                The CXC regional merit list is the pinnacle of academic prestige
                in Caribbean, with thousands of students from different
                territories competing for a spot each year. It highlights the
                top ten performers in each subject across all partcipating
                countries. <br /><br />In 2021, I wrote CSEC examinations for 9 subjects,
                earning 8 Grade 1s with full distinctions and 1 Grade 2. I was
                also honored to place 4th in Mathematics and 2nd in Physics in
                the entire Caribbean.<br /><br /> The next year, in 2022, I wrote 4 CAPE
                Unit 1 subjects, earning 4 Grade 1s with full distinctions and
                earning a place in a further 4 regional merit lists. I was
                honored to place 9th in Pure Mathematics U1, 9th in Applied
                Mathematics U1, 7th in Computer Science U1 and 9th in
                Information Technology U1.<br /><br /> I then went on to write 4 CAPE Unit 2
                subjects in addition to Communication Studies and Caribbean
                Studies the following year, earning 6 Grade 1s with full
                distinctions. Additionally, I placed 3rd in Pure Mathematics U2
                and 3rd in Applied Mathematics U2. <br /><br />In total, I have earned a
                spot in 10 regional merit lists, placing me amongst the region's
                top performers in these subjects.

                As Vice President of the Astronomy Club, I had the opportunity
                to turn my fascination with the universe into something I could
                share with others. I organized and delivered weekly
                presentations on astronomical phenomena, and I helped lead our
                team to national success in the Trinidad & Tobago National
                Astronomy Quiz, earning 3rd place in 2021 and 2nd place in 2022.
                Beyond these achievements, what mattered most to me was sparking
                curiosity among my peers and developing leadership and
                organizational skills that I continue to use today. <br /><br />I also
                devoted time to the Hillview Environmental Action League, where
                I worked with classmates to plan school-wide clean-ups and
                promote recycling initiatives. Some of my favorite memories come
                from beach clean-up events, where the impact of our efforts was
                immediately visible and deeply rewarding.<br /><br /> Finally, I was proud
                to represent Hillview on the Spartans football team for three
                years. Weekly practices and competitive matches against other
                schools taught me the discipline, teamwork, and resilience that
                come from pushing yourself both individually and as part of a
                group. These lessons continue to influence how I approach
                challenges, on and off the field.
